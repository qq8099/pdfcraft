      <p>Add Page Labels allows you to inject custom page labeling metadata (/PageLabels) into your PDF\'s root Catalog dictionary. This customizes the labels displayed in professional PDF reader navigation sidebars and top page number jump panels (e.g. using Roman numerals for front matter, decimal sequences for main body, or custom prefixes such as A-0, A-1 for technical subsections).</p>
      <p>Supports combining multiple custom rules seamlessly. Crucially, we\'ve built a highly optimized <strong>disjoint-range slicing algorithm</strong>: even if you declare complex alternating patterns (e.g., odd pages style A, even pages style B), the tool will elegantly dissect and compose boundaries to ensure proper standard-compliant display without leaking formats into unmapped pages.</p>
      <p>All operations are processed entirely inside your local browser sandbox, securing absolute data privacy.</p>

      { question: 'Will the printed dimensions match official 1" or 2" specs?', answer: 'Yes. The grid engine measures using standard PDF points (72 pt = 1 inch), rendering 1" photos exactly at 25x35mm, and 2" photos at 35x49mm. Ensure you print at "Actual Size / 100% Scale" in your printer settings.' },
      { question: 'Can I combine 1" and 2" photos on a single sheet?', answer: 'Yes. We provide curated hybrid layout presets (e.g. "4 copies of 1" + 4 copies of 2""), allowing you to maximize photo paper space.' },
      { question: 'Does the template include border bleeds?', answer: 'Yes. The prepress layouts reserve a standard 4mm print-safe margin on the paper borders, preventing physical printer rollers from cropping the photos.' },
